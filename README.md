# 🔩 Four-Bar Linkage Kinematic Simulation

This project is a **kinematic simulation of a four-bar linkage** mechanism using HTML5 and JavaScript. It features real-time rendering and motion control of the linkage, including position, angular velocity, and angular acceleration analysis.

> 🛠 Originally developed as a final project for the **Kinematics** course at *National Chung Cheng University* in 2019.

## 🎯 Features

- 🎥 Interactive animation on HTML5 canvas
- 📐 Position analysis of linkage points (Q and P)
- 🔄 Angular velocity and acceleration calculation for each bar
- 🧪 Start / Pause control buttons
- 🧮 Pure JavaScript simulation – no external libraries required

---

## 🧑‍🎓 Background

This simulation was created for educational purposes to deepen understanding of:

- Mechanism motion analysis
- Angular kinematics
- Vector geometry in linkages
- Implementation of simulation logic in JavaScript
